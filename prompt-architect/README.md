## Quick Start

```bash
npx @ckelsoe/prompt-architect
```

The interactive installer detects your AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, and more) and lets you choose where to install.

> **Important:** Use `npx`, not `npm install`. The `npx` command runs the interactive multi-agent installer. Running `npm install` will only install to Claude Code silently via the postinstall hook.

> Requires `.npmrc` with `@ckelsoe:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com` and a GitHub token with `read:packages` scope.

### Quality Scoring System

Every prompt is evaluated across:
- **Clarity** (1-10): Is the goal clear and unambiguous?
- **Specificity** (1-10): Are requirements detailed enough?
- **Context** (1-10): Is background information provided?
- **Completeness** (1-10): Are all necessary elements present?
- **Structure** (1-10): Is the prompt well-organized?

### Progressive Disclosure

- Asks 3-5 targeted questions at a time (never overwhelming)
- Adapts questions based on framework selection
- Builds understanding iteratively
- Confirms assumptions before proceeding

### Continuous Iteration

- Shows before/after comparisons with explanations
- Refines based on your feedback
- Can switch frameworks if initial choice doesn't fit
- Continues until you're satisfied

- SoT-R variant: Route non-suitable questions to standard generation

**Example Use Cases:** Technical documentation, structured reports, tutorials, any multi-section content

---

### Step-Back Prompting

**Best for:** Principle-grounded reasoning — abstract to the underlying concept first

**Approach:**
- Generate a higher-level "step-back" question about underlying principles
- Answer the abstract question to retrieve principles
- Use those principles as context to answer the original specific question

**Example Use Cases:** STEM problems, architecture decisions, debugging, any task where first-principles reasoning matters

---

### Least-to-Most (LtM)

**Best for:** Compositional multi-hop problems with ordered dependencies

**Approach:**
- Decompose the complex problem into ordered subproblems (simplest first)
- Solve each subproblem sequentially, feeding each answer into the next
- Use accumulated answers to solve the original problem

**Example Use Cases:** Multi-domain questions (legal + technical), complex calculations, architecture problems with prerequisites

---

### Plan-and-Solve (PS+)

**Best for:** Zero-shot numerical and calculation reasoning

**Approach:**
- "Let's first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and devise a complete plan. Then, let's carry out the plan, calculate intermediate values, pay attention to computation, and solve the problem step by step."

**Example Use Cases:** Financial calculations (MRR, CAC, payback), math word problems, resource estimation, any zero-shot reasoning task

---

### Self-Refine

**Best for:** Iterative quality improvement of any output

**Approach:** Generate → produce specific actionable feedback → refine → repeat until stopping criterion
**Research:** Madaan et al. NeurIPS 2023 — +5-40% improvement across 7 task types

**Example Use Cases:** Code review and rewriting, writing improvement, plan refinement, pre-submission QA

---

### CAI Critique-Revise

**Best for:** Aligning output to an explicit stated principle or standard

**Approach:** Initial output → critique against a specific principle → revision addressing every critique point
**Research:** Anthropic Constitutional AI (arXiv 2212.08073, 2022) — principle-driven alignment

**Example Use Cases:** Plain language compliance, brand voice enforcement, epistemic quality (claims vs. assertions), legal/regulatory language standards

---

### Devil's Advocate

**Best for:** Generating the strongest possible opposing argument against a position

**Approach:** Explicitly instructs the AI to attack a position as forcefully as possible — not balanced, not a straw man, but maximum-strength opposition
**Research:** ACM IUI 2024 peer-reviewed study

**Example Use Cases:** Decision stress-testing, architecture reviews, countering groupthink, stakeholder preparation, debiasing

---

### Pre-Mortem

**Best for:** Identifying specific failure causes before they happen

**Approach:** Assume the project has already failed → describe the failure → work backwards to specific causes with warning signs
**Research:** Gary Klein's prospective hindsight — ~30% improvement over forward risk analysis

**Example Use Cases:** Project kickoffs, product launches, technical migrations, high-stakes strategic decisions

---

### RCoT (Reverse Chain-of-Thought)

**Best for:** Verifying that reasoning addressed all conditions in a multi-constraint question

**Approach:** Generate answer → reconstruct the question from the answer → cross-check conditions → correct overlooked items
**Research:** Academic backward reasoning literature (ACL 2025, NAACL 2025)

**Example Use Cases:** Multi-condition logic problems, complex requirements analysis, high-stakes reasoning verification

---

### RPEF (Reverse Prompt Engineering)

**Best for:** Recovering a reusable prompt template from an existing output

**Approach:** Provide an output (and optionally the input) → AI analyzes it for tone, structure, constraints, persona → generates a reusable template with [PLACEHOLDER] variables
**Research:** Li & Klabjan, EMNLP 2025 (arXiv 2411.06729)

**Example Use Cases:** Recovering lost prompts, codifying successful one-time outputs, building style templates, understanding system prompt behavior

---

### Reverse Role Prompting (AI-Led Interview)

**Best for:** Complex tasks where you know the goal but struggle to specify all requirements

**Approach:** Provide a minimal intent statement → AI asks targeted clarifying questions → executes once context is complete
**Research:** FATA framework (arXiv 2508.08308, 2025) — ~40% improvement over standard prompting

**Example Use Cases:** Complex strategy tasks, non-expert users, requirements gathering, generating complete prompts from an interview

---

### Tree of Thought

**Best for:** Decisions where multiple approaches need systematic comparison

**Approach:**
- Defines the problem and constraints
- Explores 2-5 distinct solution branches in parallel
- Evaluates each branch against defined criteria
- Synthesizes into a reasoned recommendation

**Example Use Cases:** Architecture decisions, debugging with multiple hypotheses, technology selection, strategic trade-offs

---

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

**Best for:** Agentic tasks that interleave reasoning with tool use

**Approach:**
- Defines goal, available tools, and constraints
- Alternates Thought → Action → Observation cycles
- Each observation informs the next thought
- Continues until goal is reached

**Example Use Cases:** Agentic workflows, multi-step research, debugging with tools, data investigation

---

### Chain of Thought

**Best for:** Complex reasoning and problem-solving

**Approach:**
- Breaks down reasoning into explicit steps
- Shows work and intermediate conclusions
- Verifies logic at each stage
- Builds to final answer

**Example Use Cases:** Math problems, debugging, decision analysis, logical reasoning

---

### Chain of Density

**Best for:** Iterative refinement and compression

**Approach:**
- Starts with baseline version
- Progressively refines through iterations
- Increases information density
- Optimizes for specific goals

**Example Use Cases:** Summarization, content compression, explanation optimization

### Basic Usage

Simply ask Claude Code to improve any prompt:

```
"Help me improve this prompt: [your prompt here]"
```

### Example Interaction

```
User: "Help me improve this prompt: create a function to process user data"

Skill: I'll analyze this prompt and help improve it.

**Analysis**:
- Clarity: 4/10 (basic goal stated)
- Specificity: 2/10 (what kind of data? what processing?)
- Context: 1/10 (no background)
- Completeness: 2/10 (missing many details)
- Structure: 3/10 (single sentence)
- **Overall: 2.4/10**

**Recommendation**: RISEN framework (multi-step process requiring methodology)

**Questions**:
1. What type of user data? (names, emails, profiles, etc.)
2. What processing is needed? (validation, transformation, storage?)
3. What's the tech stack? (Python, JavaScript, database type?)
4. Any constraints? (performance, security requirements?)
5. Expected error handling approach?

User: "It's a Python function processing CSV user registrations. Need to validate
emails, normalize names, and save to PostgreSQL. Should handle invalid data gracefully."

Skill: Perfect! Let me apply the RISEN framework...

[Improved prompt generated with clear role, instructions, steps, end goal, and constraints]
